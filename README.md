# Budgeting-App
This repository contains all working files inside 'rn-starter' for my React Native app. This budgeting app is designed to help young adults learn financial responsibility since school seems to ignore that part of life. I have pushed it to the Google Play Store under the name 'yourSavings Tracker', however, I will not be publishing it on the Apple App Store since it is too expensive.

### APIs
This code is entirely API-free, relying on only Async Storage to keep user data stored locally on the phone, making it secure and offline accessible but meaning you can't switch to another device. 

### Features
-Balance Tracking  
-Spending Tracking (In Categories)  
-Savings Goals  
-Progress Tracker  

### Use
Feel free to use the code for any projects, commercial or personal. If used a recognition of contribution would be appreciated.

### Report
I wrote a report on it, detailing every aspect from the birth of the idea, to the course I took to learn react, to every component used within this project, which can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1P3t12BVfPRzM7xcJKUKYUGJ0CdncWC_EG2PuiSRLpe8/edit?usp=sharing).

Enjoy
